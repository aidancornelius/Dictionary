# dictionary

This is a very basic wrapper around some functions of PyMultiDictionary. I strung this together in sloppy Python over a weekend because I have been trying to move from macOS to Linux and this was one of the apps I needed to make things feel more like home.

I would absolutely welcome contributions to this code to make it more robust, reliable, useful and user friendly. I don't have a great deal of time to commit to this work, so if you do, please do! 

I have only tested this on Ubuntu and Debian and am unsure if it works elsewhere, though it is available as a Flatpak so theoretically it should work!

Thanks for looking. ☺️
